<p class="abstract">The deployment of new technologies and programs introduce a steep learning curve for all those who intend to use them, often involving studying a dense manual which can be extremely time consuming, and potentially very confusing. The Stratasys J850 is no exception, with the users expected to be proficient in different programs. Through experimental design, Google AI Studio was trained to analyse different images and suggest what materials and strengths would be appropriate to best replicate the physical properties of the subject in the image. The results of this research indicate the success of this experimentation, and show the practicality and efficiency of harnessing LLMs to help ease the integration of new innovative technologies.

    <p class="innerShellSpecs">For this project, the goal was to use AI to analyse images and decide the softness/hardness of different animals, and how that physicality could be best replicated using Vero and Agilus on the J850 Printer downstairs. </p>
    <p class="innerShellSpecs">Each image was meticulously chosen with specific traits to begin the experimental process. The images had to be of animals, which had no fur, hair, or feathers. They also had to be relatively simple shapes, which meant spines or scales were also out. These traits were specified so that the AI wouldnâ€™t get confused with too many different elements, and would deliver consistent results.
