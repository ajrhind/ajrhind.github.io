        The deployment of new technologies and programs introduce a steep learning curve for all those who intend to use them, often involving studying a dense manual which can be extremely time consuming, and potentially very confusing. The Stratasys J850 is no exception, with the users expected to be proficient in different programs. Through experimental design, Google AI Studio was trained to analyse different images and suggest what materials and strengths would be appropriate to best replicate the physical properties of the subject in the image. The results of this research indicate the success of this experimentation, and show the practicality and efficiency of harnessing LLMs to help ease the integration of new innovative technologies.
