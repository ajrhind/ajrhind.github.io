        <p>The goal of this assignment was to create a system that maps attributes
            of the face, and expresses the extrinsic and intrinsic values using machine learning.
            It will act as a sort of filter, and use real world data in real time to project
            onto a “photobooth” type of application, using the webcam.</p>
    <p>When I started this assignment I had one idea in my mind, and that was this sketching guide.
        I saw the opportunity to try and make something that is actually useful to someone, 
        and something even I could use. </p>
    <p>I ended up being a bit too pedantic and ambitious with how I wanted it to look, 
        and it ended up causing me to fall behind. I had wanted to originally make it look like an 
        actual sketched face, and be quick and messy looking. I soon realised that purposefully trying
        to make something look imperfect on purpose within this code space would be very very difficult.
        I knew that I was running out of time with this idea, and I didn’t want to finish this idea and leave
        it half done, so I ended up making a quick adjustment and turning it into a clown filter. I did this as
        a social commentary on the New Zealand police, and the different colours of the different parts of the
        face represented different values, like skin colour, hair colour, if they were smiling or not, etc. </p>
    <img class="showcase" src="imgs/og.png">
    <p>After I had finished with my uni work for the year, I decided I wanted to try and fix
        it up to fit more inline with my first vision. I tried to simplify the idea, and think
        about what would actually be important. It ended up coming down to the face structure,
        so I had decided to just put baselines down. I drew up a sketch on how I wanted it to
        look, how I thought it would be helpful. It ended up looking slightly scary to me,
        but I actually quite liked it.</p>
    <img class="progShot" src="imgs/codingProg.jpg">
    <p>After analysing my sketch a bit, I discovered that I really liked the harsher and more straight
        lines. The stylised angles really caught me, so I spent some time trying to figure out how I
        would adjust my previous work to my new and improved idea. I had to swap out my curveVertexes
        to regular vertexes, and I had to map out very specific points. I used a function given to
        me by a lecturer to find the average point between two of the already existing points. This
        ended up being the golden answer, and really made my design pop. I then changed the AI to map
         the colour of the models skin, and change the colour of the guidelines. </p>

    <p>Overall, compared to how I first did this, I am very happy with this outcome. I really think that this is a very helpful tool for people, and definitely for me. I would really like to develop this a lot further eventually, and make it very advanced at tracking landmarks of the face, and maybe think about involving it in AR. </p>

    <p>For this class, the goal was to create a product we would want to see implemented in the 
        future to help society. This assignment pushed for us to create and dream of things that
        could be beneficial to society, and to start thinking about how we could design around that.</p>
    <p>For my product, I designed an external patch for using drugs safely and securely. Named “DrugPlug”,
        it is designed to help people get the perfect high, perfectly tailored to them. It would work
        via a needle that will puncture the skin to take a sample of their biology. This will then
        be sent into the tiny microcomputer built within the dock of the patch, and be put through
        an AI algorithm to read and scan through everything. Once it has been through the AI, it
        will calculate a perfect dosage based on what the user has selected on the app. It will
        then take a few minutes to start preparing to send the user into the trip, and allows
        time for the user to set up. </p>
        <p>I originally came up with this idea by thinking about what I thought was an issue with current society, and what would make people happier, healthier, and safer. In my ideal future society, a lot of the labour intensive jobs would be taken over, and society would instead have a huge focus around science and technology. Learning and recreation would be encouraged. I thought about how people around my age enjoy the occasional substance at a party, and how I could make it safer. I went through many versions of how this could work. At first it would be a little pocket device, and then I took inspiration from a brooch and decided to make it a removable patch</p>

    <p>I decided to design this product because in an ideal future I would imagine that recreational
        drugs aren’t criminalised, and people are free to use them to have a good time and relax.
        I would also really want for people to be able to administer them safely, and not have to
        worry about an accidental overdose, or not getting the high they wanted. With the AI 
        embedded in the technology, it would also help to prevent issues such as drug induced
        schizophrenia, addiction, psychotic episodes etc. Every Time the device is wanting 
        to be used it will be reading the users biology and chemistry, and keep it monitored 
        to help with these issues.

    <p>In this class, the goal was to use Unreal Engine for spatial visualisation, to display
        some of our past work and projects. This assignment worked as an interactive portfolio,
        to showcase some of our work and also push us to code some inputs. </p>
    <p>For my assignment, I designed an eccentric artists workshop. I chose to do it like
        this because I found that most of my work varies a lot, and it is not very cohesive.
        I wanted to further drive this point home by making the workshop quite messy and
        a bit all over the place. I had random objects everywhere, some making lots of
        sense, like easels, and some getting quite unsettling, like dentistry tools. 
        In the end I wanted it to emulate some of my fellow design students' lockers
        or desks, full of questionable but helpful things.</p>
    <img class="showcase" src="imgs/gameEn1.png">
    <p>I showed some art that I had created outside of university, and two of my university
        projects, including a Coding project, and a Costume design report. In total, I had
        about 5 pieces being showcased. I chose to include my drawings because I felt it added 
        more to the workshop scene, and made it seem more realistic. I added the coding project
        more as a side piece, and not a main because I had a computer screen, and I wanted it 
        to seem like a screensaver, more leaning into that actual assignment. I added the costume
        design report as well, as I thought it seemed quite out there, but also it fit because 
        of that reason. It didn’t make a lot of sense to actually be there, so I put it in, to 
        help capture the Chaos. </p>

    <p>This course was about investigating how industrially designed products will respond
        to the people and environment around it. We were tasked with finding ideas for a 
        responsive product, and then experiment and develop until we were left with a sleek
        and well thought out final product. </p>
    <p>My idea revolved around an artistic experience. I made my product as a light installation,
        and it responded to voices and talking. The meaning behind it was meant to be a 
        legitimate “conversation piece”, where talking would actually make it work. I wanted
        the experience to be about curiosity, wonder, and excitement. The Ideal interaction for
        this piece is some passing people, having a normal conversation while on a walk, and
        then all of a sudden, out of the corner of their eyes, they see something light up. 
        They then walk over to investigate, and ask each other what it could be, when they 
        realise, it actually is reacting to them talking! They then are excited about it, and
        play around with it, shouting, whispering, testing its capabilities. After this, they 
        then walk away with a new shared experience.</p>
    <img class="showcase" src="imgs/lamp1.JPG">
    <p>I decided on the physical design by thinking about what would be the natural form
        of this experience. I would think that it would be smooth, fun, exciting, and fluid.
        I also had to think about where I would want it to be placed. I wanted this to be
        something you had to find, and come across, so I decided I wanted it to be out 
        of the way, somewhere among nature. The ideal spot would have been the Wellington
        Botanical Gardens, or somewhere similar. I also decided that since this would
        be more of a “natural” design, I would only use materials I had, or something
        I could easily reuse. </p>
